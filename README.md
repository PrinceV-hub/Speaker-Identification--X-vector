# Speaker Identification Using X-Vectors

This repository implements a speaker identification system using the **X-Vector architecture**, which extracts speaker embeddings from audio files for robust speaker recognition. The system processes audio files, extracts MFCC features, trains a deep neural network, and performs both speaker identification and verification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Speaker Recognition Dataset** available on Kaggle. It contains audio files from multiple speakers, sampled at 16kHz.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

The `requirements.txt` file includes:

* numpy>=1.21.0
* tensorflow>=2.1.0
* matplotlib>=3.3.0
* pandas>=1.1.0
* librosa>=0.8.0
* tqdm>=4.62.0
* scikit-learn>=0.24.0
* seaborn>=0.11.0

## Repository Setup (For Maintainers)

### Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository named **speaker-identification-xvector**.
2. Initialize it with a README (optional, as one is provided here).

### Clone the Repository Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speaker-identification-xvector.git
cd speaker-identification-xvector
```

### Create the Files

Create the following files in the project directory:

* `main.py`: Main script for the X-Vector pipeline.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.
* `.gitignore`: File to exclude unnecessary files from Git.

Copy the respective contents into each file (refer to the repository files).

### Add and Commit Files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with speaker identification X-vector implementation"
git push origin main
```

---

## User Setup (For Running the Project)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speaker-identification-xvector.git
cd speaker-identification-xvector
```

### Download the Dataset

* Download the dataset from Kaggle.
* Extract the dataset and place it in a folder named `16000_pcm_speeches` in the project root directory.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Update Data Path

In `main.py`, update the `DATA_PATH` variable to point to the location of the dataset folder if different from the default (`16000_pcm_speeches/`).

## Usage

Run the main script to perform data loading, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and speaker identification:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:

* Load and preprocess the audio data.
* Extract MFCC features and create fixed-length segments.
* Build a dataset for training.
* Train an X-Vector model.
* Evaluate the model on a test set.
* Extract and visualize embeddings.
* Perform speaker identification on a sample audio file.

The model and embeddings are saved in the project directory:

* Trained model: `xvector_speaker_recognition_[timestamp]_best.h5`
* Embeddings: `train_embeddings.npy`, `val_embeddings.npy`, `test_embeddings.npy`
* Speaker prototypes: `speaker_prototypes.pkl`

---

## Project Structure

* `main.py`: Main script containing the complete pipeline for speaker identification.
* `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.
* `.gitignore`: Git ignore file for excluding unnecessary files.

---

## Notes

* The dataset should be organized with speaker names as subdirectories containing `.wav` files.
* The model is trained on a GPU if available; otherwise, it uses the CPU.
* The X-Vector model uses a TDNN-based architecture with statistics pooling for robust speaker embeddings.
* Visualizations (confusion matrix, t-SNE plots) are generated during execution.

ðŸ‘‰ Just copy everything above into a file named `README.md`. Done ðŸŽ‰  

Do you also want me to prepare a **ready-to-paste `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`** file in the same style?
