# Speaker Identification using X-Vector Embeddings

A complete implementation of speaker identification using X-vector embeddings with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features

- X-vector model implementation with TDNN architecture
- MFCC feature extraction with cepstral mean normalization
- Speaker verification and identification capabilities
- Visualization of speaker embeddings
- Performance evaluation with Equal Error Rate (EER) calculation

## Dataset

The model was trained on the [Speaker Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kongaevans/speaker-recognition-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains audio recordings of 5 speakers.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speaker-identification-xvector.git
